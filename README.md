# Cryptocurrencies

#Overview


You and Martha have done your research. You understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. It’s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. She’ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.
